# MLOps Project - Video Game Recommendation System

This repository documents the development of a video game recommendation system. The project is organized into the following key stages:

1. **01_ETL**: Initial Data Cleaning
   
2. **02_EDA**: Exploratory Data Analysis

3. **03_ML**: Data Preparation and System Implementation
   
4. **04_API**: Deployment and Useful Information
   

## 01_ETL:

    This stage involves the data initial exploration and transformation.


## 02_EDA:

   Exploration of the data to identify patterns and understand the characteristics of the video game dataset.


## 03_ML:

   Prepare the data for machine learning and developing the recommendation system.


## 04_API:

    Deploy the recommendation system as an API and some endpoints with useful information.
