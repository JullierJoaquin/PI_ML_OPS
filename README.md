This repository documents the development of a video game recommendation system. The project is organized into the following key stages:

- [01_ETL](01_ETL.ipynb): Initial data cleaning scripts.

- [02_EDA](02_EDA.ipynb): Exploratory data analysis notebooks.

- [03_ML](03_ML.ipynb): Data preparation and recommendation system implementation.

- [04_API](04_API.ipynb): Deployment for the recommendation system and other useful information.


#### 01_ETL:

This stage involves the data initial exploration and transformation.


#### 02_EDA:

Exploration of the data to identify patterns and understand the characteristics of the video game dataset.


#### 03_ML:

Prepare the data for machine learning and developing the recommendation system.
